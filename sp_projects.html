        <h2>Speech processing</h2>
		<p> Speech processing is the study of human speech signals, their representation, and the development of models and algorithms to perform some task such as speaker identification, speech enhancement or simply storing these signals most effectively on disk. Owing to the flexibility of programming software and the availibility of cheap computer memory, speech processing is usually processed in its digital representation. Hence speech processing can be regarded as a special application of digital signal processing to speech signals.</p>
		
		<h3> Speech enhancement using non-linear estimate of statistical properties of non-stationary noise sources.</h3>
		<p> Our project focused on designing and building a single-channel speech enhancement system for far-end noise reduction. The given speech signal was assumed to be corrupted with additive complex Gaussian noise. As a requirement, we needed to design an algorithm for estimating the power spectral density (PSD) of both the non-stationary noise and the clean speech. This is a challenging problem, because the statistical properties of non-stationary noise change over time. Hence the PSD needs to be estimated adaptively, and the speech enhancement needs to be adaptive as well. Moreover the algorithm complexity needed to be reasonably low, since such a system will most likely be used in digital hearing aids. Such systems typically have power constraints and hence cannot work with too complex algorithms.</p>
