		<h2> About me</h2>
		<!--Personal-->
		<p> Hi, I'm Yadnyesh a machine learning researcher and software programmer. My journey started as an Electronics & Telecommunication Engineer at <a href="http://www.mitpune.com/">M.I.T. - Pune</a> in India where I got introduced to the field of artificial intelligence. My first project classified the handwritten script on postal envelopes into two categories, English and the local script <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari">Devanagari</a>. It was meant to assist in sorting envelopes at local postal offices.</p>

		<!--Academic-->
		<p>I realized that I wanted to pursue higher education in this field and attended the Master's in Electrical Engineering program at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands from 2014 till 2017. There I focused on theoretical concepts from the fields of signal processing & classical pattern recognition. I decided to continue participating in academic research, but wanted to focus on practical aspects within these fields. Hence I decided to attend Clemson University's Master of Science program in Computer Engineering.</p>		

		<!--Work-->
		<p>I enjoy solving challenging problems from the domains of computer vision, data science and machine learning. My most recent work got published at the <a href="https://bigdataieee.org/BigData2020/AcceptedPapers.html">2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data</a>. It describes a deep learning model for simultaneously detecting and classifying periods of wrist activity into distinct categories known as eating gestures. Other projects that I've worked on include renewable energy forecasting and day-ahead price forecasting for the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) which I worked on as a Data Scientist at Climate Connect Pvt. Ltd. I also have experience in teaching undergraduate and graduate students, having being employed as a Co-Researcher at the Department of Computer Engineering at Maharashtra Institute of Technology - Pune and as a Graduate Teaching/Grading Assistant at Clemson University.</p>

		<!--Skills-->
		<p>Through my education and professional experience I've built a strong foundation in applied mathematics, optimization, software programming and statistical analysis. I also have solid programming skills in Python and C, including system programming, bash scripting and deep learning model design using the TensorFlow and PyTorch API's.</p>

		<!--Hobbies-->
		<p>Other than programming I enjoy swimming and playing basketball. I'm a big fan of Michael Phelps and his absolute domination at the Butterfly event for over a decade. In basketball I play the guard position, and pattern my game after Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and Steph Curry, three of the greatest at their position. I support the Los Angeles Clippers, and am actively rooting for a title in the 2020 - 2021 season.</p>
