	<h2> About me </h2>
	<p> Hi, this is Yadnyesh Luktuke! I'm actively looking for a job in the domains of data science, machine learning and signal processing. Up until recently I was a graduate student in Clemson University, where my research focused on automatic segmentation and classification of eating related activities from wrist-motion data using deep learning. Eating related activities are those such as moving food from the plate to the mouth, moving a glass or container to the mouth and sipping a drink while holding it, preparing a morsel of food and dipping food in sauce or gravy among a wide range of other movements. When eating an unscripted meal, people will have different variations and durations in their wrist movement for such activities. This makes detecting such activities difficult for a large group of people. In addition, activities completely unrelated to eating also occur frequently during a meal. These include activities such as gesturing to a friend, checking one's phone or simply placing the hand at rest. Due to the different combinations and durations of such activities in people, automatically detecting and classifying these is a non-trivial problem.<p>

	<p> I also have experience in predictive analysis and designing classification models for data such as census records, images, speech and stock-prices using techniques from computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning and signal processing. Most of my programming experience lies in using languages such as Matlab, Python and C. However I am comfortable learning new programming languages and technologies, and am keen to expand my horizons in other related domains as well. In addition to this, I am a skilled instructor, having taught undergraduate and graduate students and have overseen their end of semester projects.
    
	<h2> Educational background </h2>
	<p> I received my Bachelor's in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (2012) from Maharashtra Institute of Technology - Pune, which was affiliated with the University of Pune. I then obtained my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (2017) from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), The Netherlands. At TU Delft my research focused on intensity normalization of 3D brain MRI images of the same patient using machine learning. This approach is thought to be useful in automatic diagnosis and follow-up studies of patients, especially those that relocate after serious medical conditions or injuries. I will soon graduate from Clemson University, USA with a Master of Science in Computer Engineering in May 2020.</p>

	<h2> This site </h2>
	<p> I'm hoping to teach myself some basic HTML programming and website design. Over the next few weeks, I'm hopeful that I'll be able to create a web based portfolio for myself, which will include my research interests, specific skills and technical knowledge which I'm hoping will help me land my first job after completing my Master's.</p>	
	<p> If you've some helpful suggestions, or tips and tricks that I could use to expedite my learning, please drop an email at luktuke.yadnyesh@gmail.com. I'm really starting afresh with this journey!</p>	

	<h2> Update </h2>
	5th May 2020: GitHub allows files to be hosted in the same repository. Somehow I did not realize that images/files can be displayed without the need for a url based link. Unsure about using CSS for formatting the website still.
