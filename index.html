		<h2> About me</h2>
		
		<p> UPDATE! I have joined Ford Motor Company on a contract basis as a Mobility Research Engineer, working on making cars smarter for the future. </p>
		<!--Personal-->
		<p> Hi, I'm Yadnyesh an electronics engineer, machine learning researcher and software programmer. I grew up in the city of Pune, India and have briefly lived in Delft, in The Netherlands. Currently I'm staying in San Francisco, California enjoying the quiet lifestyle that its residents seem to like as well. </p>
		
		<!--Academic-->
		<p>My academic journey started as an Electronics & Telecommunication Engineer at <a href="http://www.mitpune.com/">M.I.T - Pune</a> in India where I was introduced to the field of artificial intelligence. My first project classified the handwritten script on postal envelopes into two categories, English and the local script <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari">Devanagari</a>. I-PASS as it was called, was meant to assist in sorting envelopes at local postal offices. I attended the Master of Electrical Engineering program at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands from 2014 till 2017. There I focused on theoretical concepts from the fields of signal processing & classical pattern recognition.</p> 
		
		<p> I decided that I needed more practical experience in academic research, and hence attended Clemson University from 2018 till 2020. As part of the Master's in Computer Engineering program, I have worked on projects from the fields of electronic sensors, computer vision and deep learning. Recently, my Thesis got published at the <a href="https://bigdataieee.org/BigData2020/AcceptedPapers.html">2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data</a>. It describes the first deep learning model that has been developed for simultaneously detecting and classifying periods of wrist activity into distinct categories known as eating gestures. Identifying periods of food or drink intake can be used to estimate the calories consumed as demonstrated <a href="https://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/bite-counter/">here</a>.</p>		

		<!--Work-->
		<p>I enjoy analyzing challenging problems and developing novel software solutions for solving these. Some of the projects that I've worked on include renewable energy forecasting and day-ahead price forecasting for the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX), which I worked on as a Data Scientist at Climate Connect Pvt. Ltd. I also have experience in teaching undergraduate and graduate students, having being employed as a Co-Researcher at the Department of Computer Engineering at M.I.T - Pune and as a Graduate Teaching & Grading Assistant at Clemson University.</p>		

		<!--Skills-->
		<p>Through my education and professional experience I've built a strong foundation in applied mathematics, optimization, software programming and statistical analysis. I also have solid programming skills in Python and C, including system programming, bash scripting and deep learning model design using the TensorFlow and PyTorch API's.</p>

		<!--Hobbies-->
		<p>Other than programming I enjoy swimming and playing basketball. I'm a big fan of Michael Phelps and his absolute domination at the Butterfly event for over a decade. I also enjoy cooking and trying new dishes and restaurants. Please leave a message via email if you found this site interesting and would like to discuss some topic, or you've a position in mind that you think I'd be a good fit for.</p>
