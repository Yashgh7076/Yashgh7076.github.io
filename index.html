		<h2> Educational background </h2>
			<p> I received my Bachelor's in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (2012) from Maharashtra Institute of Technology - Pune, and obtained my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (2017) from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). The coursework at TU Delft focused majorly on mathematical optimization of pattern recognition and signal processing algorithms. For my thesis I conducted research on intensity normalization and 3D reconstruction of multi-scanner brain MRI images using machine learning. This approach is thought to be useful in computer-aided diagnosis and follow-up studies of patients that relocate after serious medical conditions or injuries.</p>

		</p> I felt the need to improve my skills as a researcher and software developer, and hence decided to pursue a graduate degree from Clemson University. I worked on problems in machine learning, deep learning and tracking systems as well as other aspects of engineering such as sensor instrumentation and statistical set-up and analysis of experiments. These have become the foundation stones for most of my research activity over the past two years. I graduted from Clemson University with a Master od Science in Computer Engineering in May 2020. </p>

		<h2> Recent work </h2>

		    <p> My research at Clemson University focused on implementing a novel deep learning classifier that could detect periods of motion from an eating activity data set. The data was recorded using IMU sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) fitted inside a watch-like device that kept on recording while people ate their meals naturally. The model could also simultaneously classify each detected period of motion into one of the known categories of activities or 'gestures'. To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported work to train a neural network end-to-end at semantically segmenting IMU time-series data. Please see the <a href="projects.html">Deep Learning</a> page under the Projects tab for more information on this research.</p>

		<h2> This site </h2>
		<p> I mainly created this site for reaching out to recruiters, researchers and alumni in search of new job opportunities in the United States of America. If you have an opportunity that requires research and software development skills in computer vision, deep learning, machine learning and/or signal processing please reach out via the email ID mentioned above.</P>
