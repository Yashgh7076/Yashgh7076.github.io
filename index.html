		<h2> Educational background </h2>
			<p> I received my Bachelor's in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (2012) from Maharashtra Institute of Technology - Pune (M.I.T. - Pune), which was affiliated with the University of Pune. I then obtained my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (2017) from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), The Netherlands. At TU Delft my research focused on intensity normalization of 3D brain MRI images of the same patient using machine learning. This approach is thought to be useful in automatic diagnosis and follow-up studies of patients, especially those that relocate after serious medical conditions or injuries. I graduated from Clemson University, USA in May 2020.</p>

		<h2> Recent work </h2>

		    <p> My research at Clemson University focused on implementing a novel deep learning classifier that could detect periods of motion from our eating activity data set. The data for our experiments was recorded using IMU sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) fitted inside a watch-like device that kept on recording while people ate their meals naturally. The model could also simultaneously classify each detected period of motion into one of the known categories of activities, also known as a 'gesture'. Ours is the first work in the world to train a neural network to perform semantic segmentation on time-series data. Please see the <a href="projects.html">Deep Learning</a> page under the Projects tab for more information on this research.</p>

		<h2> This site </h2>
		<p> I mainly created this site for reaching out to recruiters, researchers and students in search of new job opportunities in the United States of America. If you have an opportunity that requires research and software development skills in computer vision, deep learning, machine learning and/or signal processing please reach out via the email ID mentioned above. </P>
