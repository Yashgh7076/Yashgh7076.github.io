	<h1>Update April 22nd: Creating a webpage on GitHub!</h1>
	Learning to create a website by following wikihow. Testing that it can be re-opened multiple times without needing to clear browser history. Here goes! Was that successful? Time to find out. It seems it works on Firefox, no it doesn't.
	<h2>Time to move on maybe?</h2>
	Is this an issue with GitHub? I need the webpage to refresh immediately.
