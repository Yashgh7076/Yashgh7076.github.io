	<h1> Educational Background </h1>
	<p> I received my Bachelor's in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from Maharashtra Institute of Technology - Pune, which was then affiliated with the University of Pune in 2012, and my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), The Netherlands in 2017. I will soon graduate from Clemson University, Clemson - USA with a Master of Science degree in Computer Engineering in May 2020. The majority of my coursework at the graduate level has focused on the domains of computer systems programming, deep learning, digital signal and image processing, machine learning and pattern recognition.</p>
	<h2> This site </h2>
	<p> I'm hoping to teach myself some basic HTML programming and website design while improving my ability at writing neat, clean and concise codes in C and Python. Over the next few weeks, I'm hopeful that I'll be able to create a web based portfolio for myself, which will include my research interests, specific skills and technical knowledge which I'm hoping will help me land my first job after completing my Master's.</p>
	<p> If you've some helpful suggestions, or tips and tricks that I could use to expedite my learning, please drop an email at luktuke.yadnyesh@gmail.com. I'm really starting afresh with this journey!</p>
