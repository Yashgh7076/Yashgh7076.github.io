	<h2> About me </h2>
	<p> Hi! I'm Yadnyesh Luktuke, an engineer who is actively looking for a job in the domains of data science and machine learning. Up until recently I was a graduate student in Clemson University. My research focused on automatic segmentation and classification of eating related activities from wrist-motion data using deep learning. I have previously worked on predictive analysis of different types of data, such as census records, images, and speech using techniques from computer vision, machine learning, pattern recognition and signal processing. I am skilled at data analysis and system programming using Python and C. I also have experience teaching undergradute and graduate students in areas from electrical, electronics and computer engineering.
	
	<h2> Educational background </h2>
	<p> I received my Bachelor's in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (2012) from Maharashtra Institute of Technology - Pune, which was then affiliated with the University of Pune. I then obtained my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), The Netherlands in 2017. At TU Delft my focused on intensity normalization of 3D MRI scans of the brain using machine learning. I will soon graduate from Clemson University, USA with a Master of Science in Computer Engineering in May 2020.</p>

	<h2> This site </h2>
	<p> I'm hoping to teach myself some basic HTML programming and website design. Over the next few weeks, I'm hopeful that I'll be able to create a web based portfolio for myself, which will include my research interests, specific skills and technical knowledge which I'm hoping will help me land my first job after completing my Master's.</p>	
	<p> If you've some helpful suggestions, or tips and tricks that I could use to expedite my learning, please drop an email at luktuke.yadnyesh@gmail.com. I'm really starting afresh with this journey!</p>	

	<h2> Update </h2>
	3rd May 2020: I'm successfully able to apply a CSS stylesheet to the html pages. Waiting for news on file-hosting to start posting some pictures!
