		<h2> About me </h2>
		<p> Hi, this is Yadnyesh Luktuke. I'm actively looking for a job in the domains of data science, machine learning and deep learning. Up until recently I was a graduate student in Clemson University working under the guidance of <a href="http://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/">Dr. Adam Hoover</a>. Here my research focused on automatic segmentation and classification of eating gestures from wrist-motion data using deep learning. As a part of this research, we developed a novel neural network model that was capable of simultaneously detecting and labeling periods of eating related activities from data that was recorded when subjects ate an unscripted meal.<p>

		<p> I also have experience in predictive analysis and designing classification models for different types of data such as census records, images, speech and stock-prices using techniques from computer vision, pattern recognition, signal processing and tracking systems. Most of my programming experience lies in using languages such as Matlab, Python and C. However I am comfortable learning new programming languages and technologies, and am keen to expand my horizons in other related domains as well. In addition to this, I am a skilled instructor, having taught undergraduate and graduate students and overseen their end of semester projects. </p>

	    <h2> Educational background </h2>
	    <p> I received my Bachelor's in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (2012) from Maharashtra Institute of Technology - Pune (M.I.T. - Pune), which was affiliated with the University of Pune. I then obtained my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (2017) from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), The Netherlands. At TU Delft my research focused on intensity normalization of 3D brain MRI images of the same patient using machine learning. This approach is thought to be useful in automatic diagnosis and follow-up studies of patients, especially those that relocate after serious medical conditions or injuries. I graduated from Clemson University, USA with a Master of Science in Computer Engineering in May 2020.</p>


	    <h2> This site </h2>
	    <p> I'm hoping to teach myself some basic HTML programming and website design using CSS. Over the next few weeks, I'm hopeful that I'll be able to create a web based portfolio for myself, which will include my research interests, specific skills and technical knowledge which I'm hoping will help me land my first job after completing my Master's.</p>
	    <p> If you've some helpful suggestions, or tips and tricks that I could use to expedite my learning, please drop an email at luktuke.yadnyesh@gmail.com. I'm really starting afresh with this journey!</p>

	    <h2> Update </h2>
		6th May 2020: Finally found a CSS stylesheet that I like! Working on making drop-down links for displaying things such as different projects. Micro update, figured out how to use softwrap for text in my text editors and made it the default setting. <br>
		<br>

		Success! Dropdown works as expected. Header appears consistent in all webpages as well. <br>
		<br>

		7th May 2020: Planning on adding table of results under deep learning. Also planning on adding projects in other categories. Hopefully will have all other sections working as well, and be able to publish final (draft) website.
		12:00 noon: Profile picture and contact info displayed without using tables. <br>
		<br>

		8th May 2020: 8:46 a.m. mailto added to email address on homepage.<br>
		<br>

		10th May 2020: We're ready to go live!<br>
		<br>

		13th May 2020: Updated info - success, I've graduated from Clemson University!
