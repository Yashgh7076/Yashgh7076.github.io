		<h2> About me</h2>
		<p> Hi! I am a recent graduate from the Master of Science - Computer Engineering program at Clemson University, specializing in machine learning, deep learning, mathematical modeling and statistical analysis. I also have a background in digital signal processing, classic pattern recognition theory and optimization thorugh my earlier Master's in Electrical Engineering from Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands.</p>

		<p>I enjoy solving challenging problems from the domains of computer vision, data science and machine learning using software such as TensorFlow, Python and C programming. Some of these problems are renewable energy forecasting and day-ahead price forecasting for the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) which I worked on as a Data Scientist at Climate Connect Pvt. Ltd.. I also have experience in teaching and training undergraduate and graduate students, having being employed as a Co-Researcher at the Department of Computer Engineering at Maharashtra Institute of Technology - Pune and as a Graduate Teaching/Grading Assistant at Clemson University.</p>

		<h2>Recent work</h2>
		At Clemson University I conducted research on deep learning models for simultaneously detecting and classifying periods of wrist motion activity into pre-defined categories known as eating gestures. These are useful to analyze eating behavior in humans, and also for the development of an automatic energy intake monitoring system such as the original <a href="http://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/bite-counter/">Bite Counter</a> developed at Clemson University. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work in the world that has successfully developed a deep learning model for performing semantic segmentation on 1D time-series data recorded using inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. Please see the <a href="projects.html">Deep learning</a> page on this website for more information. Our work has been submitted for review to the `2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data'.
