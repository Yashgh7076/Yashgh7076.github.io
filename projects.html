<p> I have been involved, both as an individual and as part of a team with different projects as a graduate student and as a professional. This page describes some of these projects in greater detail for the interested reader. </p>
<h2> Deep Learning Projects </h2>

<p> In machine learning, deep learning classifiers are a part of the family of neural networks. These are capable of learning features from data using interconnections between nodes arranged in the form of layers. In addition, deep learning neural networks can also learn combinations of these features, that can be used to classify the data correctly. Hence such networks are particularly useful for our research, where the data set contains a lot of variation for a large group of people whose wrist-motion was recorded while they ate their meals.

<p> Recently there has been a significant increase in the use of deep learning for a wide range of automatic tasks such as data classification, image annotation and text-to-speech conversion.
