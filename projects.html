<p> I have been involved, with different projects both as an individual and as part of a team over the past few years. These have really been the foundational stones to most of my experience, both as a graduate student and a professional. This page describes some of these projects in greater detail for the interested reader. </p>

<h2> Deep Learning Projects </h2>

<p> Neural networks are a computational tool, which can be used for machine related tasks such as data classification, image annotation and image segmentation. These consist of units known as neurons, which are inspired by biological neurons present in brain cells. When multiple neurons, each having a similar function are arranged together the resulting arrangement is known as a layer. Typically neural networks have atleast three different types of layers, an input layer used for broadcasting the input to subsequent layers, an output layer for converting the neural network response to a form most suitable for the particular task and one or more hidden layer. The hidden layers work by mapping the input data into increasingly complex manifolds or dimensions, such that characteristics of the data can be used to perform the machine task accurately.</p>

<p> Deep learning classifiers are a part of the family of neural networks, and consist of far more hidden layers than conventional neural networks. In addition, the function of each hidden layer is usually different from that of its neighboring layers. Using these different layers, deep learning classifiers can not only learn better mappings of input data, but also better combinations of these mappings. This improves the accuracy of the classifier tremendously. Hence deep learning models have been used in many state-of-the-art applications such as handwritten digit classification, self-driving cars and synthetic image synthesis, with new applications being used or updated regularly.
