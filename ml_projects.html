		<h2>Machine learning</h2>
		<p>Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that learn to do a task by incrementally improving the model that is fit to data known as training data. Model fitting is the approach in which a mathematical equation or series of equations is used to describe the available data. Model fitting makes use of one or more characteristics of the data such as its appearance or distribution to generate such an equation or set of equations that describe the available data. Model fitting is used extensively in engineering and scientific studies to understand an underlying process that generates the available data.</p>
		
		<p>The usefulness of a model is determined by how accurately the equation or set of equations can be used to describe the data already available, or new data that becomes available after a model is fit to a particular data set. In machine learning fits, the model is fit to data known as training data. However the performance of a machine learning model is usually determined based on how well the model can predict or describe data that it has not seen before, which is called the test data. This is usually a part of the training data itself, but is separated before the model is fit, and reserved for testing once a suitable model has been found. This process is also known as training the machine learning algorithm.</p>
		
		<p> We may also choose to evaluate the model continuously, as it is being trained, by further separating a small part of training data before the model is fit and evaluating the model performance on both the training data and the new data set known as validation data. In such a case, we expect that the model performance improves incrementally well for both the training data and the validation data during training. This is considered separate from the model performance on the test data, which is evaluated once the model has been trained.</p>

		<p>Based on the available data, and the choice of model that is being fit to it, machine learning can be broadly classified into supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In the former, the expected behavior of the model is known beforehand and is stored in vectors known as targets or labels for the model to train on. These are usually generated synthetically by humans that can observe the original process, and hence know how to characterize its behavior. In contrast, in unsupervised learning, the target vectors are unknown or cannot be generated. The machine learning model that is fit to such data typically makes use of some or the other optimality criterion that can be easily understood based on the characteristic of the data such as its apparance, distribution or the relationship between its components.</p>
