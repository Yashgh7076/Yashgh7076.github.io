		<p> I have been involved with different groups, sports teams and organizing committees outside of the regular course requirements. These have genuinely given me a profound sense of freedom and instilled a sense of responsibility that hard-work and commitment should go beyond the classroom and office. I have made friends while I was a part of these different teams, and many of these are life-long friendships that I will cherish. I am particularly proud of my involvement with the swimming team during my Bachelor's. I started on the relay team as a freshman and established myself as one of the important team members, eventually being appointed as the captain of the men's team in my final year at M.I.T - Pune.</p>
