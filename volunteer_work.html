		<p> I have been involved with different groups, sports teams and organizing committees outside of the regular course requirements. These have genuinely given me a profound sense of freedom and belief that hard-work and commitment should go beyond the classroom and office. I have made friends while I was a part of these different teams, and many of these are life-long friendships that I will cherish.</p>
