				 <p> MS Thesis: Segmentation and recognition of eating gestures from wrist motion using deep learning. Implemented the first deep learning neural network to simultaneously identify and label (semantic segmentation) periods of wrist motion into predefined categories based on specific set of activities occuring in each period of motion.</p>
				 
				 <p>Wrist motion can be classified into distinct catgories or 'gestures' based on the activity occuring in a particular period of time, such as moving food from the plate to the mouth ('bite'), moving a cup towards the mouth ('drink'), prepare a morsel of food, or dip food in gravy/sauce ('utensiling'), resting in between different activities ('rest') and all other activities collectively termed as 'other'.</p>	
				 
				 <p> Our model achieved close to 80% average accuracy per meal at identifying all eating related gestures in the meals considered here: <a href="http://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/cafeteria/">Clemson Cafeteria Dataset</a> with close to 20% standard deviation on average per meal. This indicates that the implemented model is robust against changes in wrist motion for a large group of people, and can be raliably used to track eating activity in people.

				<p> MSc Thesis: Intensity normalization in brain MRI images using machine learning. Conducted research on techniques for synthetically generating brain MRI images using a target intensity-scale. This method would transform MRI images from one intensity-scale to a fixed scale (target), and was proposed to expedite clinical diagnosis and follow-up in patients that relocated after serious injuries.</p>
