				 <p> <i>MS Thesis: Segmentation and recognition of eating gestures from wrist motion using deep learning.</i> Implemented the first deep learning neural network to simultaneously identify and label (semantic segmentation) periods of wrist motion.</p>
				 
				 <p>Wrist motion can be classified into distinct catgories or 'gestures' based on the activity occuring in a particular period of time, such as moving food from the plate to the mouth ('bite'), moving a cup towards the mouth ('drink'), prepare a morsel of food, or dip food in gravy/sauce ('utensiling'), resting in between different activities ('rest') and all other activities collectively termed as 'other'.</p>	
				 
				 <p> Our model achieved close to 80% average accuracy per meal at identifying all eating related gestures in the meals considered here: <a href="http://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/cafeteria/">Clemson Cafeteria Dataset</a> with close to 20% standard deviation on average per meal. This indicates that the implemented model is robust against changes in wrist motion for a large group of people, and can be raliably used to track eating activity in people.
