			<li> <p>MS., Clemson University, Computer Engineering. </p>
				 <p> MS Thesis: Segmentation and recognition of eating gestures from wrist motion using deep learning. Implemented the first deep learning neural network in the world to simultaneously identify and label (semantic segmentation) periods of wrist motion into predefined categories based on specific set of activities occuring in each period of motion.</p>
				 
				 <p>Wrist motion was recorded using IMU sensors fitted in a watch-like device, and it can be classified into distinct catgories or 'gestures' based on the activity occuring in a particular period of time, such as moving food from the plate to the mouth ('bite'), moving a cup towards the mouth ('drink'), prepare a morsel of food, or dip food in gravy/sauce ('utensiling'), resting in between different activities ('rest') and all other activities collectively termed as 'other'.</p>	
				 
				 <p> Our model achieved close to 80% average accuracy per meal at identifying all eating related gestures in the meals considered here: <a href="http://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/cafeteria/">Clemson Cafeteria Dataset</a> with close to 20% standard deviation on average per meal for each gesture type related to eating. This indicates that the implemented model is robust against changes in wrist motion for a large group of people, and can be raliably used to track eating activity in people.

			<li> <p>MSc., Delft University of Technology, Electrical Engineering. </p>
				<p> MSc Thesis: Intensity normalization in brain MRI images using machine learning. Conducted research on techniques for synthetically generating brain MRI images using a target intensity-scale. This method would transform MRI images from one intensity-scale to a fixed scale (target), and was proposed to expedite clinical diagnosis and follow-up in patients that relocated after serious injuries.</p>

		<h2> Professional Experience </h2>
		<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

			<li> <p>Data Scientist, Climate Connect Pvt. Ltd., Aug. 2017 - Jan. 2018</p> 

				 <p> Majorly worked on designing and implementing predictive models for forecasting trends in renewable energy and energy market data sets. My designed model had 36% better forecasting accuracy at predicting stock prices in the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) for a period of 4 months. As part of my responsibilities as a Data Scientist I was also responsible for scraping data from client databases, developing software solutions and debugging them as required before their final deployment.</p>

				 <p> Technologies I worked with include, Python for most of the model development process. However I also worked sparingly with R programming for development on some of the companies older projects. I also have experience in writing SQL queries and in using the libraries numpy, pandas, scikit-learn and scipy having used these frequently during this time.</p>

			</li>

			<li> <p>Engineer Trainee, Cognizant Technology Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Dec. 2012 - Oct. 2013</p>

				 <p> As a part of the support team within the offshore development center associated with Lloyds Bank Plc., I was trained in Mainframe technology and the IBM z/OS. My responsibilities included monitoring all jobs running on client servers and documenting their start and end times. I was also responsible for reporting failure of critical jobs to higher management within the team and the client organization as well.</p>
